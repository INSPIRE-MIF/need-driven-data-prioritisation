# Repository for INSPIRE MIWP Action 2.1 'Need-driven data prioritisation'

The [Action 2.1 “Need-driven data prioritisation”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.1+Need-driven+data+prioritisation) is defined in the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24) with aim to drive the further implementation (data and services availability, accessibility and interoperability) of the INSPIRE Directive by a real demand and tangible use cases by setting data priorities, and supporting the creation and availability of pan-European datasets and applications for different policies, e.g. environmental policies, European Green Deal Data Space. 

Furthermore, and beyond the scope of ongoing prioritisation initiatives (e.g.  the Commission geospatial requirements paper and the activity on priority data for environmental reporting, …), the data prioritisation should also consider the new political agenda (e.g. Biodiversity Strategy, Circular Economy Action Plan, Zero Pollution Action Plan, …) and emerging legal frameworks and (e.g. High Value Data Sets under the Open Data Directive, EU common data spaces, …). The data prioritisation methodology would consist of selecting those data sets that satisfy concrete needs of the stakeholders (local, regional, national, and European administrations for implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, Community legislation, etc.) and for which interoperability should be pursued.

The Action is led by the DG ENV and EEA, with contribution by the JRC, Member States, EFTA Member States and European Commission DGs, depending on use cases: Eurostat, DG CNECT and DG AGRI.

## Actions
The proposed actions encompass the following:
1. Develop a prioritisation methodology.
2. Document data priorities (use case(s), data requirements, reuse capacity …) and demonstrate possible data usage. 
3. Manage data priorities as list(s) of priority INSPIRE datasets (e.g. priority list of datasets for e-Reporting, core data sets, High Value Datasets) and develop guidance for their implementation. 
4. Identify, discuss and remediate priority data implementation issues e.g. by considering or proposing alternative data sources (e.g. Copernicus, open source data) to complete pan-European availability. 
5. Support fast-track data requests, e.g. based on the European Commission request for spatial data.
6. Monitor the availability of the data priority datasets in the INSPIRE Geoportal.
