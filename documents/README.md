# Information and documents

Priority data sets correspond to specific use cases, such as e-Reporting (related to reporting obligations of EU environmental policies and legislation and activities on streamlining environmental reporting) or emerging legal frameworks (e.g. High Value Data Sets under the Open Data Directive, EU common data spaces, …), and support the creation and availability of pan-European datasets and applications for different policies. The Action 2.1 exchanges information on priority data sets requirements and synergies supporting the goal that “data set collected once can be shared with others for many purposes”.

## Priority list of data sets for e-Reporting
The **INSPIRE priority list of datasets for e-Reporting** is primarily focused on the data sets in the scope of the reporting obligations of the environmental legislation. The list is a living inventory of environmental information needs and as such provides an instrument to incrementally build comparable INSPIRE maturity across MS for all INSPIRE components (metadata, services, interoperability, data sharing) based on a common setting, and to monitor the progress on INSPIRE implementation.

### Rolling priority list of data sets
The current version of the list of priority data sets, version 2.1 final as of October 2020, is to be considered the reference version of the list for implementation by Member States. The list has been scrutinized and further detailed by the subgroup (Member States, Commission and EEA).

* [FAQ document](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/priority-datasets/blob/main/documents/INSPIRE_PDS_FAQ_v3.0.pdf)

### Implementation guidance – tagging (INSPIRE metadata keywords)
The priority data sets for e-Reporting are tagged with specific metadata keywords ([INSPIRE Priority data set](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/PriorityDataset)) which identifies obligation, e.g. legislation (e.g. Directive 2000/60/EC - Water Framework Directive) and content (e.g. WFD river basin districts). The metadata record of the priority data set for e-Reporting can include several metadata keywords to describe the origin of the data set or applicable use required by different legislation and reporting obligations (a data set is reused / referenced in different reporting obligations). Further on, those keywords are used in the INSPIRE Geoportal applications providing a simple entry point to data sets and possibility to monitor the provision and use of priority data sets for e-Reporting.

### Reference to previous work in the action INSPIRE MIWP 2016.5
The INSPIRE 2016.5 action was initiated to address data gaps identified during the evaluation of the state-of-implementation and the fitness of the INSPIRE Directive for its intended purpose (a so-called REFIT evaluation). 
The action was further strengthened in the INSPIRE MIWP 2017-2020 work programme under "Working area 2: End user applications" with aim to further develop a list of data sets related to environmental reporting and support Member States with making these datasets accessible through the European Spatial Data Infrastructure in a stepwise manner. 

Detailed information about this work and outcomes is available on the [INSPIRE MIWP 2016.5](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2016.5%3A+Priority+list+of+datasets+for+e-Reporting) web page.

## High-Value Data Sets
As part of the [European Strategy for Data](https://data.europa.eu/en/highlights/data-governance-act-open-data-directive), the Open Data Directive ([Directive (EU) 2019/1024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj)) functions as a common legal framework for government-held data (public sector information) and is geared towards two key concepts in the European market: i.e. transparency and fair competition. The Directive defines high-value datasets which means “documents the re-use of which is associated with important benefits for society, the environment and the economy, in particular because of their suitability for the creation of value-added services, applications and new, high-quality and decent jobs, and of the number of potential beneficiaries of the value-added services and applications based on those datasets.” 

List of **thematic categories of high-value datasets**, as referred to in Article 13(1) of the Directive (EU) 2019/1024:
**1. Geospatial** 
**2. Earth observation and environment** 
**3. Meteorological** 
**4. Statistics** 
**5. Companies and company ownership**
**6. Mobility**

## Common and interoperable European data models in scope of environmental reporting
Streamlining of environmental reporting is progressively including geospatial data relying also on INSPIRE specifications and infrastructure. The scope of common European data models is to ensure reported data are harmonised, comparable and of certain quality to allow evaluation of environmental policies and compliance check of reporting obligations.

## Other information about environmental reporting and infrastructure
Most of the reporting data flows are provided in Reportnet - Eionet’s infrastructure for supporting and improving data and information flows. Reportnet 3.0 is the new e-Reporting platform for reporting environmental and climate data to the European Environment Agency (EEA).

## Prioritisation methodology
A common methodology for monitoring progress of implementation of priority list of data sets (initially designed in the scope of priority data sets for e-Reporting) provides a basis for comparative and up-to-date information about the accessibility and readiness of data sets and services in INSPIRE infrastructure. The proposed methodology relies on the harvested metadata records from the national discovery services which are available through the INSPIRE Geoportal to evaluate the progress towards a set of implementation targets (geographic coverage, time reference, and INSPIRE data model harmonisation). It considers also the regulatory INSPIRE monitoring indicators that are regularly updated and presented on a dashboard.
